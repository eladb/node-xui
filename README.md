# node-xui

An npm package wrapper for the awesome [xui.js](http://xuijs.org).

This currently doesn't work on the server, only the browser. I am using it to create client side onejs apps that use xui 
explicitly (and not assuming it is in the global namespace).

TODO:
 * Support using jsdom to bind it to a server side document.

## Install

Install with npm:

```bash
$ npm install xui
```

Bundle with [onejs](https://github.com/azer/onejs).

## Usage

```javascript
var x$ = require('xui');
x$('bla').havefun();
```

See [xui.js](http://xuijs.org) for documentation.
